üîÆ The API exposes an endpoint which returns the details of a given IP address `[CountryName, TwoLetterCode, ThreeLetterCode]`, first looking up in cache memory and if no cached data is available calls to the IP2C service to fetch.

‚åö IP information is periodically fetched and checked for changes from the IP2C service (in an hourly timespan).

ü§ñ The API exposes a second endpoint that returns a report on how many addresses per given country (by TwoLetterCode) exist in the database, along with the last time an IP of said country was updated, as below:
```json
{ CountryName:string, AddressesCount:int, LastAddressUpdated: DateTime }
```
